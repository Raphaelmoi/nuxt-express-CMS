# Nuxt-Express CMS (Never Finished and Ugly)

Welcome to Nuxt-Express CMS, a CMS project that aims to utilize Nuxt.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend. Please note that this project is currently in its early stages and is far from completion. Expect bugs, incomplete features, and an overall lack of polish.

## Introduction

Nuxt-Express CMS is intended to provide a simple yet functional content management system for websites. It leverages the power of Nuxt.js for server-side rendering and client-side interactivity, coupled with Express.js for building the backend API.

## Features

- Basic user authentication (login, logout)
- CRUD operations for managing content (create, read, update, delete)
- Minimalistic UI (very much work in progress)

## Technologies Used

- Nuxt.js
- Vue.js
- Express.js

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install` in both the `frontend` and `backend` directories.
3. Set up your MongoDB database and configure the connection in the backend.
4. Start the backend server by running `npm start` in the `backend` directory.
5. Start the frontend development server by running `npm run dev` in the `frontend` directory.
